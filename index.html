            <p>If you're reading this it's too late. Welcome to my very first website! Glad you could join me. Looking forward to updating this as my skills improve over the next several months, but for now bear with me.  </p>
            <p>A little more about me... I currently work at Sony PlayStation on their TV streaming product called PlayStation Vue. I'm a business owner of a feature called Megaphone that sends in-app messages to our current customers. I work with network partners like HBO and Disney to help promote their content on our service. I decided to take this bootcamp to move over to the more techincal side of the business. Fingers crossed!</p>
